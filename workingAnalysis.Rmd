This document represents the various modeling efforts we have tried for the HKM2014 paper.  First step in this analyis is to set up the groups of variables.  Four groups were initiall indentified.  First, are the water quality variables from NLA.



## All Variables - Landscape Total Area

This first random forest predicts Cholorophyl Trophic status using all NLA variables, all GIS variables except for the landscape variables w

```{r allLandscapeArea}

```


## All Variables - Landscape Percent

```{r allLandscapePercent}

```


## GIS Only Variables - Landscape Total Area

This first random forest predicts Cholorophyl Trophic status using 

```{r gisLandscapeArea}

```


## GIS Only Variables - Landscape Percent

```{r gisLandscapePercent}

```
