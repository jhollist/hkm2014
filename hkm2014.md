#### Keywords: National Lakes Assessment, Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyl a



Introduction
------------


What are the primary determinants of lake trophic status?  Determinants include, chemical and physical paramenters of the lake water column and land use/land cover.  Lake trophic status defined by Chl a.


Methods
-------

### Data

The two primary sources of data for this study are the National Lakes Assesment data and the National Land Cover Dataset [@usepa2009national]

#### Predictor Variables

**Water Column**

**Landscape**

We defined the surrounding landscape of a lake with four different buffer distances: maximum in-lake distance [@hollister_predicting_2011], 300 meters, 1500 meters, and 2500 meters.  The various distances were used to tease out differences in local landscape effects versus larger landscape-level effects. For each of these distances, we used the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) and calculated the percent impervious and total area of each landcover class.  

#### Independent Variables

Chl a Trophic status from NLA.  What are the cut-offs.

### Statistical Analyses
